The Jacob's Ladder was a toy we forgot. We flipped it, watched it's cascading blocks fall as if they could forever, then we threw it in a box and left it for decades.  It was a puzzle we couldn't solve - a simple mystery and an unanswerable question.

As adults we were confident we could comprehend it - reverse engineer and calculate the coefficients, deconstruct it and build it over-sized, watch it closely in slow-motion. We thought we would understand, and yet it has left us equally bewildered. 

THiNGS ChANGE consists of a series of over-sized Jacob's Ladders and is inspired by the nostalgia of childhood and the modern world's constant reminder that things are forever changing and the forever the same.
