Working closely with Julie, the owner of the Jewel Box, we built a new brand from scratch: from the name itself to the one-of-a-kind murals - even down to the foiled business cards. We knew Julie had dozens of loyal clients who would travel hundreds of miles to have her style and cut their hair. Naturally, it was our goal was to provide The Jewel Box with an equally unique and memorable brand that would be impossible for those who had visited to forget.
