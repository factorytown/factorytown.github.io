Ras Omy K had a simple but powerful dream: that we are all responsible for one another. A few months later returned to Rwanda to bring health care to hundreds of kids who needed it the most. While he was home, he saw how the simple act of sharing health and security with others made him feel stronger himself. He asked everyone he met to share their stories and to dance with him. The week he arrived back in Washington with his family he brought back with him those stories and shared those dance moves and we made this video.

Impanda is dedicated to the empowerment of children by hearing their call to be treated as the powerful agents of change that they are. By promoting self-reliance through investment in the individual, we create a worldwide culture and connections from city to city, country to country across the world.
