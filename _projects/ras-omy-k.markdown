Ras Omy K had a simple idea: that we are all responsible for one another. A few months ago he returned to Rwanda to bring health care to hundreds of kids who needed it the most. While he was home, he saw how the simple act of sharing heath and security with others made him feel stronger himself. He asked everyone he met to share their stories and to dance with him. The week he arrived back in Washington with his family he brought back with him those stories and shared those dance moves and we made this video.

****Impanda**** dedicated to the empowerment of children by hearing their call to be treated as the powerful agents of change that they are. By promoting self-reliance through investment in the individual, we create a worldwide culture and connections from city to city, country to country across the world.

To everyone who was a part of this video, your spirit and dancing is the energy that continues to create change. To those who couldn't make it, thank you for watching. Come learn more about us at http://ImpandaRwanda.org Special thanks to Kaufman and Associates.
