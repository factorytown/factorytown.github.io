We reached out to the Spokane International Film Festival to help with their upcoming festival and branding. Together we developed a set of five bumper advertisements that would play before each of the films in the festival. The concept was part promotion, part film experiment. 

The idea was based on a classic test in film-making called the Kuleshov effect. This was a phenomenon discovered in the early 1900s by Lev Kuleshov by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot alone. The viewer would identify different emotions in the protaganist based on what other images accompanied the footage. You can read more about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect).

In the bumper we recorded one performance from an actress and paired it with differing clips and music. Each final ten-second film would be edited to embody a popular genre in film, from action to thriller to comedy to romance to sci-fi.
