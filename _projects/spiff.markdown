Part promotion, part film experiment. We reached out to the Spokane International Film Festival to help with their upcoming festival and branding and came up with a unique set of bumper advertisements that would play before the films in the film festival that could only work with film enthusiasts. 

Together we developed an idea based on a classic test in film-making called the Kuleshov effect. This was a phenomenon discovers in the early 1900s by Lev Kuleshov by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot alone. 

In the bumper we recorded one performance from an actress and paired it with differing clips and music. Each finished ten second film would be edited to embody a popular genre in film, from action to thriller to comedy to romance to sci-fi.
