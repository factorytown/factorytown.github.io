## WHAT WE BELIEVE

We're a creative agency founded on the idea that stories are the most valuable commodity we have. We work closely with brands and non-profits to understand their vision and to bring it to life through memorable storytelling.

## WHO WE ARE

We're a dual director studio. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and  imaginative visuals. We work in both fiction and non-fiction to solve puzzles.

## WHERE WE ARE

Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us sometime, we'd love to show you around.
