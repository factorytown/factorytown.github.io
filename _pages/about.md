## WHAT WE BELIEVE
Story is the universal language. We pass them down through different dialects. We call them drama or comedy, tale or tragedy. They are our most powerful tool.

## WHO WE ARE
We're a writer-director studio. We work with cinema, photography, and design to create imaginative visuals and impactfull tales - both fiction and non-fiction.

Rajah Bose is a photographer and filmmaker with two decades behind the camera. 

Ellen is a muralist and painter with installations across the world. 

## WHERE WE ARE
Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest - Spokane to be precise. 
It's one of the most beautiful areas we know.
