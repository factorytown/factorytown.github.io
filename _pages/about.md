## FACTORY TOWN™


### WHAT 

## We see art as our common language and stories as our currency. We bring people and organizations together through stunning visuals and memorable experiences. 

## FACTORY TOWN™ services include: 
## Creating content for commercial advertising. We work with you to produce videos, photos, and printed materials to reach your customers.

## Writing and directing independent cinematic films from short documentaries to music videos. 

## Designing art objects and installations that bring us out from behind our screens, helping us experience the real world together.

### WHO

## We're a dual-director studio. That just means we collaborate to get your message across effectively and artistically. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and imaginative visuals that are entertaining and interactive.

<BR>

### WHERE

## Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Spokane, Washington. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us sometime, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza.

### HOW

## We hate forms, so drop us a line, an insta direct, a telegram or just #hashtag us. We'll get back to you.
