### WHAT

## We see art as our common language and stories as our currency. We work closely with brands, non-profits, and artists to bring together their their purpose and vision. 
<BR>

### WHO

## We're a dual-director studio. That just means we are collaborative in our efforts to help you get your message across effectively and artistically. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and imaginative visuals. We like to play in fiction and non-fiction with the goal of solving puzzles.
<BR>

### WHERE

## Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Spokane, WA. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us sometime, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza or something.
<BR>

### HOW

## We hate forms too. So drop us a line, a tweet, an insta direct, a telegram or just #hashtag us. We'll get back to you.
