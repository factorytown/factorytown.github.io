### WHAT WE BELIEVE

We're a creative agency founded on the idea that stories are the most valuable commodity we have. We work closely with brands and non-profits to understand their purpose and vision and together bring it to life through memorable storytelling.

### WHO WE ARE

We're a dual-director studio. That just means we are collaborative in our efforts to help you get your message across effectively and artisticall. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and imaginative visuals. We like to play in fiction and non-fiction with the goal of solving puzzles.

### WHERE WE ARE

Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Spokane, WA. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us sometime, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza or something.
