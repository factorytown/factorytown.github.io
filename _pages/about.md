### WHAT

## We see art as our common language and stories as our currency. We work closely with brands, non-profits, and artists to bring together their their purpose and vision in a memorable way.

<BR>

### WHO

## We're a dual-director studio. That just means we collaborate to help you get your message across effectively and artistically. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and imaginative visuals. We like to play equally in fiction and non-fiction. Our main goal is to find out what's wrong and help fix it.

<BR>

### WHERE

## Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Spokane, Washington. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us sometime, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza or something.

<BR>

### HOW

## We hate forms, so drop us a line, an insta direct, a telegram or just #hashtag us. We'll get back to you.
