### WHAT 

## Art is our common language. Stories are our currency. 
We bring people and organizations together through visual experiences. 

## So yeah, we create content - commercials, ads, little thingies for social. We work with you to produce videos, photos, and stuff to help you reach people.

## We're into creating new things - helping us experience this intensely weird real world together.

<BR>

### WHO

## We're a dual-director studio. We collaborate to get your message across effectively and artistically. 

<BR>

### WHERE

## Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, in Spokane, Washington. It's one of the most beautiful places we know. Come visit, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza.

### HOW

## Drop us a line about anything. We'll get back to you.
