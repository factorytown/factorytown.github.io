### WHAT 

## We see art as our common language. Some say that's math, but we prefer to compute in color. Stories are our currency and we bring people and organizations together through visual experiences. 

## We create content - commercials, ads, little thingies for social. We work with you to produce videos, photos, and stuff to help you reach people.

## Writing and directing - from music videos to documentaries to short films. 

## Designing art objects and installations that bring us out from behind our screens, helping us experience the real world together.

### WHO

## We're a dual-director studio. That just means we collaborate to get your message across effectively and artistically. We work with our hands to make cinema, photography and imaginative visuals that are entertaining and interactive.

<BR>

### WHERE

## Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Spokane, Washington. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know. Come visit us, we'd love to show you around and take you to pizza.

## Drop us a line, an insta direct, a telegram or just #hashtag us. We'll get back to you.
