WHY
Story is the universal language. We pass them down through different dialects. We call them drama or comedy, tale or tragedy. They are our most powerful tool.

WHO 
We're a writer-director studio. We work with cinema, photography, and design to create imaginative visuals and impactfull tales - both fiction and non-fiction.

Rajah Bose is a photographer and filmmaker with two decades behind the camera. 

Ellen is an artist and muralist with installations across the world. 

WHERE
Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest - Spokane to be precise. It's one of the most beautiful areas we know.

HOW
Tell us what you're dreaming about, metaphorically speaking, unless you just want to get a dream interpretation, because we're actually not so bad at that either. 

Also, we're not that into filling out forms.
