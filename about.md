WHY
We're searching for that feeling we get when you see something inescapably true. We believe stories are universal 

WHO 
We're a writer director studio. We work with cinema, photography, and design.

Rajah is a photographer and filmmaker with two decades behind the camera. Ellen is an artist and muralist with installations across the world. At Factory Town we don't stress the titles, we work together with artists and brands to create stories you'll remember. 

WHERE
Factory Town is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest, in one of the most beautiful areas we know.

HOW
Tell us what you're dreaming about, metaphorically speaking, unless you just want to get a dream interpretation, because we're actually not so bad at that either. 

Also, we're not that into filling out forms, so let us know the old fashion way :)
