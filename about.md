We're always searching for that feeling we get when you see something inescapably true.

We're small writer director studio, with a big ability to take an idea and make it visual. 

Rajah is a photographer and filmmaker with two decades behind the camera. Ellen is an artist and muralist with work across the US. At Factory Town we don't get hung up on the titles, we work together and with artists and brands to create stories you'll remember.

So tell us what you're dreaming about, metaphorically speaking, unless you just want to get a dream interpretation, because we're actually not so bad at that either.
