Every city's got a DOT, luckily New York's is an arts forwards organization. We were stoked to be working with them and their vision to beautify areas in all five Burroughs. Working on the streets of Williamsburg, right under the Hewes Street stop, we got to know the locals a bit and some of the kids, even got a few free coffees from our friends at The Flats. The space transformed a street into a walking park to give people jumping off the train a few moments to collect their thoughts or grab a rental bike.
